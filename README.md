# Joystick
When I was experiencing the product recently, I found that the Joystick was super difficult to use, so I put forward an optimization request for the product, hoping that they could optimize the experience from the user's point of view. After a long time, there was no movement, so I took time out when I couldn't be free. I picked up a Joystick myself.
